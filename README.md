# Microservices Communication using RestTemplate

<br>

## Overview
In synchronous communication, the client sends a request and waits for a response from the service.And one of Synchronous Communication multiple Microservices is RestTemplate.<br> <br>
In this project, I have implemented department-service, user-service, and integration-service that communicate with these two Microservices. Besides that, I have separated the database for each Microservice.
